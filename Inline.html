      A black hole is a cosmic body of extremely intense gravity from which even light cannot escape.
       Black holes usually cannot be observed directly, but they can be “observed” by the effects of
        their enormous gravitational fields on nearby matter.
        A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing – no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light – can escape from it. 
        The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.
